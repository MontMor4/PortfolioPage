                    I am a Computer Engineering student at CEFET-MG focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Generative AI (GenAI).
                    My practical experience includes developing solutions with LLMs (using LM Studio) for report automation,
                    research in genetic algorithms (AI), and software development (Python and JavaScript).
                    Award-winning in programming marathons, I actively seek opportunities to build and apply AI models
                    in high-impact products, aligned with what iFood values.
